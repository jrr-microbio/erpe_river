 *This directory contains code for the identification and generation of qc'ed viral and microbial genomes from the Erpe River dataset. You will also find instructions on how to annotate these genomes, and how we did virus-host linking.*
 
 For very detailed, step-by-step instructions of general viral identification, host-linking, and QC, please see the tutorial repository here: https://github.com/jrr-microbio/metag_virus_training
